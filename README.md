# Covid_19-Global-Data-Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis of global COVID-19 data to uncover trends in cases, deaths, testing, and daily growth rates using Pandas &amp; Matplotlib.


 COVID-19 Global Data Analysis
 
 1)Project Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing global COVID-19 data to understand trends in cases, deaths, testing, and growth rates across different countries. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations to extract meaningful insights from the dataset.

2)Problem Statement
To analyze global COVID-19 trends and identify:

Global daily new cases and deaths trend

Countries with highest positive rate

Countries experiencing rapid daily case growth

Overall pandemic impact using data-driven insights

3)Dataset
Source: Our World in Data

Contains information such as:

Total Cases

New Cases

Total Deaths

New Deaths

Total Tests

Positive Rate

Population

GDP per capita

Human Development Index

And many more indicators

4)Technologies Used
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn


5)Key Analysis Performed
1️⃣ Global Trend Analysis

Compared daily new COVID-19 cases and new deaths globally.

Identified pandemic waves and peak periods.

2️⃣ Positive Rate Analysis

Identified top 10 countries with highest positive rate.

Highlighted testing effectiveness and case detection efficiency.

3️⃣ Daily Growth Rate Analysis

Calculated daily growth rate:

Daily Growth Rate (%) = (New Cases / Previous Day Total Cases) × 100

Identified countries at risk of new COVID waves.

6) Key Insights
Global cases showed multiple waves over time.

High positive rate countries indicate insufficient testing.

Some countries experienced sudden spikes in daily growth rate.

Countries with better healthcare infrastructure showed controlled mortality trends.
